AtHackers.PreLibraryTest is the test project created for the AtHacker password hashing library, a lightweight .Net nuget library that  provides seamless
password hashing and encryption for developers. 
It allows for the creation of safe passwords for database storage by integrating the best and  most powerful hash functions. (SHA2 variants(256,384, and 512 )
and Bcrypt).
It provides opportunities for developers to choose between options of these Secured Hash Algorithms (SHA) hash functions to safely hash and store passwords, 
and protect applications 
from susceptible hacking attacks and schemes.
